## ⚠️ Important Note

This tool is intended for **educational/demo purposes only**.  
In real-world applications, passwords should be hashed **server-side** using algorithms like:

- **bcrypt**
- **argon2**
- **PBKDF2**

Never hash or store passwords directly in client-side JavaScript for production security needs.
